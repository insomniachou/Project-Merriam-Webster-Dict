Quick lookup on Meriiam-Webster website

This is an extension to lookup word definition on merriam-webster offical website. No need to copy and paste for millions of times. Simply right click on the selected word and click "See definiton on Merriam-Webster", the word's definition you're looking for will show in a popup window. Close the window and continue what were doing.

TODO for Chrome OS user
I'm trying to cooperate with existing Meriiam-Webster Web App, try to show the word directly in the app if opened, if not open the app and then show the meaning.
